## Abstract

The Guly Point defines a critical temporal threshold in human survivability: the point beyond which a human being consuming only one type of food, regardless of its caloric or nutrient content, will inevitably experience fatal biological decline. This decline results from the absence of nutritional diversity, not from the absence of food itself.

The Guly Point encompasses all cases of monodietary dependence, whether the food is energy-rich (e.g., wheat), nutrient-dense (e.g., liver), or seemingly benign (e.g., bananas, carrots). In each case, the exclusive reliance on a single, unvaried food source leads — at different rates — to progressive deficiency, systemic breakdown, and eventual death.

## Definition

Guly Point (or Guly Threshold)  
> The maximum span of time a biologically typical, otherwise healthy human can survive when consuming only one type of food, after which death results from cumulative nutritional insufficiency caused by the absence of essential elements required to sustain complex biological function.  
>  
> The model assumes unlimited access to clean water, isolating nutritional insufficiency as the sole cause of decline. The specific nutritional profile of the food determines the timing, but not the inevitability, of death.

## Background and Motivation

Most survival models emphasize starvation (caloric deficiency) or dehydration as leading causes of mortality. But real-world scenarios — from famine zones to institutional diets — have shown that eating regularly is no guarantee of survival. A person may continue to consume food and still die, slowly, from the incompleteness of that food.

The Guly Point provides a way to define and isolate this quiet trajectory of failure. It captures a situation where food is present, but the required complexity of nutrients is missing. This failure, often unrecognized, can lead to irreversible damage or death — especially in controlled or resource-limited settings.

## The Guly Curve

The Guly Curve represents the physiological degradation path of a human under monodietary conditions. It illustrates a conceptual trajectory of gradual erosion in internal systems — immune, neurological, muscular, hormonal — over time.

Within this curve, an inflection point may occur: a moment when the damage becomes irreversible, even if nutritional restoration follows. Irreversibility here refers to:
- Loss of organ or system function
- Neurological or vascular damage
- Permanent metabolic or structural failure

This inflection precedes the Guly Point (death), and varies by food type and individual resilience.

## Application and Use

The Guly Point is proposed as a conceptual and scientific unit of survival analysis. It may prove useful in:

- Nutritional ethics (refugee camps, institutional food systems)
- Famine response planning
- Experimental or historical modeling of human diet limits
- Public understanding of how food can harm without being absent

## Naming and Authorship

This concept is proposed and authored by Sergey Guly (Сергей Гулый) in 2025. The term “Guly Point” (also Guly Threshold) is introduced here for the first time and accompanied by an initial theoretical framework.

Any reference to this concept should cite this document and credit its author.
